# Grant-Ready Language (Copy/Paste)

## 1) Problem Statement
Students are navigating increased stress, conflict, and emotional dysregulation that can impact learning readiness and classroom climate. Schools need consistent, culturally resonant SEL supports that are low-lift for staff and safe for youth.

## 2) Solution Overview
Z-Girl Hero Coach is a fictional, warm “hero coach” that supports youth reflection and regulation through:
- emotional labeling and validation
- quick body-based reset tools (breathing, grounding)
- small, realistic next steps (“hero moves”)
Z-Girl is **not therapy** and does not provide medical advice or diagnoses.

## 3) Theory of Change
When students have immediate access to simple regulation tools and supportive reflection prompts, they are more likely to:
- self-regulate faster
- seek help appropriately
- return to learning with improved readiness
Over time, repeated micro-practice builds durable habits.

## 4) Safety & Ethics (key differentiator)
- Clear boundaries: no medical/legal guidance, no harm encouragement
- Crisis language: prompts students to contact trusted adults and local emergency resources
- Privacy-first posture: no ads, no selling student data; content-free analytics options

## 5) LEAP Alignment (example language)
Z-Girl aligns to LEAP through daily micro-practices:
- **Listen & Label**: name feelings, reflect needs
- **Ease the body**: breathing / grounding exercises
- **Act with intention**: one small next step
- **Practice & Persevere**: saved “Hero Moments” + weekly guided reflection

## 6) Measurement (pilot-friendly)
Engagement (content-free):
- sessions/week
- breathing starts
- hero moments saved
- hero path completion
School indicators (pilot-selected):
- teacher-rated readiness
- fewer escalations
- improved help-seeking
- student self-report: calmer / more confident

## 7) Implementation Plan (6-week pilot)
Week 1: kickoff + staff orientation  
Week 2–6: student use during advisory/SEL/counselor referrals  
Monthly check-in + end-of-pilot report
