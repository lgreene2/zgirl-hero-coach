# Parent Onboarding Emails (5-part sequence)

> Tone: warm, trustworthy, non-clinical. No therapy claims.

## Email 1 — Welcome
**Subject:** Welcome to Z-Girl 💛 A hero coach your family can trust  
**Preview:** Here’s how to use Z-Girl in a healthy, supportive way.

Hi {{FirstName}},

Welcome! Z-Girl is a gentle “hero coach” that helps kids and teens slow down, name feelings, and choose one small next step.

A quick way to start tonight:
1) Ask your child: “Want to try a 30-second hero breath with Z-Girl?”  
2) Let them pick a mood chip (optional).  
3) Celebrate one tiny win they share.

Z-Girl isn’t therapy — she’s a safe reflection space that encourages trusted adult support when things feel heavy.

## Email 2 — The 3 Best Moments to Use Z-Girl
**Subject:** The best times to use Z-Girl (it’s not when everything is perfect)  
**Preview:** These 3 moments make the biggest difference.

Hi {{FirstName}},

Here are three great moments to use Z-Girl:
- **Before school:** a quick breath + confidence line  
- **After conflict:** reset + “what’s my next hero move?”  
- **Before sleep:** name the feeling + one small win

You don’t need long sessions. Even 2–5 minutes counts.

## Email 3 — How to Talk About Big Feelings (Without Lectures)
**Subject:** A simple script that helps kids open up  
**Preview:** Try this 2-sentence opener.

Hi {{FirstName}},

Try this opener:
> “I’m here. You don’t have to fix it alone.”  
> “Want help finding one small next step?”

If your child shares something heavy, a powerful hero move is connecting with a trusted adult (you, a counselor, teacher, coach).

## Email 4 — Using Hero Moments (and why it works)
