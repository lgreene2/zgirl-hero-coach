## 1) Cold intro
**Subject:** School-safe SEL support tool: Z-Girl Hero Coach (LEAP-aligned)

Hi {{Name}},

I’m reaching out to share **Z-Girl Hero Coach**, a culturally responsive SEL companion aligned to the LEAP framework.
It helps students regulate, reflect, and choose one small next step — **not therapy**, and designed with safety boundaries.

Would you be open to a 20-minute intro call?

Best,

## 2) Follow-up
**Subject:** Quick follow-up — Z-Girl Hero Coach pilot

Hi {{Name}},

Following up — we can run a **6-week pilot** with light reporting (content-free) and minimal staff lift.
Happy to tailor metrics to your goals (readiness, escalations, help-seeking).

Open to a short call next week?
